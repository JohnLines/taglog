<h1>Tag Logging Program</h1>

Where does the time go ?
<p>
What are my priority jobs for today ?
<p>
How can I spend less time on routine adminstrative tasks ?

<p>
Taglog is written to answer these questions. 


<h2>What is taglog?</h2>
<p>
The current version is
0.2.4
<p>
Taglog provides an electronic workbook, combining logging of time to projects
with keeping a detailed diary of what you actually do. Individual work
elements can be tagged by project, allowing you to produce, for example, a
record of work on one particular project, even if your time is spread across
a number of projects.
<p>
Work items can also be tagged by activity type - for example meeting, phone,
programming etc - allowing you to analyse where your time is going by activity.
Note that this activity type is orthogonal to the project axis, so that - for
example - user support would be a project - in the larger sense WHAT you are
doing - and phone calls to users - HOW you are doing it - would be the activity
type.

<h2>Downloading and Installing</h2>

The current version of the software is available as
<a href="taglog-latest.tar.gz">taglog-latest.tar.gz</a>
<p>
Look <a href="changelog">here</a> for the latest<a href="changelog">changes</a>

<p>
Taglog is what is known as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">Free Software</a>, or Open Source.
<p>
Taglog is written in the TCL scripting language, which is available for Unix,
Windows and Macintosh systems.
See <a href="http://www.tcl.tk/">http://www.tcl.tk - the TCL developer Exchange</a> for more
information - including downloading TCL for free.

<p>
Taglog is in regular use on Unix (Linux and Solaris) and Windows systems.
<p>
The <a href="http://johnlines.github.io/taglog/">installation instructions</a> are included with the
distribution, but are available <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JohnLines/taglog/master/INSTALL">here</a> for convenience.

<p>
Windows users will need a program, such as
<a href="http://www.powerarchiver.com">Powerarchiver</a> or
<a href="http://www.pkware.com">pkzip</a> to unpack the distribution.
Alternatively you could install <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">
Cygwin</a> which gives you many powerful Unix tools for free on your Windows
PC.

<h2>The Tutorial</h2>

You may wish to read <a href="doc/tutorial.html">a taglog tutorial</a> (which
is included in the documentation in the distribution) before you download.


<h2>Applications</h2>

You can find descriptions of how various kinds of people might use taglog
by following these links.

<ul>
<li><a href=teachers.html>Teachers</a>
<li><a href=scientists.html>Scientists</a>
<li><a href=programmers.html>Programmers</a>
<li><a href=lawyers.html>Lawyers</a>

</ul>

Note that these are just examples to draw out particular facilities of the
program


<h2>Developer information</h2>

Patches and suggestions are welcomed. Please bear in mind that taglog is
targetted at a range of platforms and TCL versions. The internal structure
is not fully stable, so there is not much developer documentation yet,
though there is a Unix manual page for the main tag.tcl package.
<p>
If you are not a TCL programmer, but can write in a language for which
taglog internationalisation is not yet available you can still help, as
described in the <a href="internationalisation.html">Internationalisation
Guide</a> or translating this page, or the <a href="tutorial.html">tutorial</a>


<h2>Further information</h2>

The log file format for taglog, and the file format for its actions files are
described in <a href="https://johnlines.github.io/tag-types/">the tag-types home page</a>

<p>
Other links can be found in the <a href="links.html">Time Management Resources</a> page.

<h2>Sourceforge</h2>
Taglog is now a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/taglog/">project on Sourceforge</a> - to allow use if its mailing list and bug tracking
facilities, and you can obtain the releases from there as well - from 0.1.51 onwards.
