<h1>Taglog for scientists</h1>
<br>
A scientific researcher can use taglog on a computer in their laboratory
as a research log. They could use the Action Sequences facility to set up
the steps they expect to take in an experiment, and then follow the actions
as they are displayed. Their notes about what happened will be associated
with the log entry for the action.<br>
