<h1>Taglog for Teachers</h1>
<br>
Teachers, in the UK at least, face a avalanche of paperwork in addition to
their activities directly related to the curriculum. While taglog can not
do much to assist teachers in the classroom it may be useful in planning
and recording non contact time. Future developments may be useful to help
with the lesson planning and assessment. It can also be used to record the
split of non contact time accross subject areas, for example by teachers
who have a responsibility for a subject, or for Special Needs provision.<br>
<br>
You could use Taglog's contacts facility to keep a class list, and use that
to keep track of actions related to specific pupils. A future facility will
let you import and export contacts from Outlook or other email systems which
use the vCard format, and you could use that to make a class mailing list.<br>
<br>
Coming to this page will be instructions on how to extract portions of your
class list to other programs and print them - for example as a list of people
going on a trip.<br>
