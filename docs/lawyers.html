<br>
First a disclaimer.<br>
<br>
Please note that Taglog is Free Software, make available for your use at
your own risk under the terms of the <a

are concernedabout having someone carry the liability for the program you
are free to hire a software consultant to customise the program to your requirements.
You should ask them to review the proper functioning of the program in the
areas in which you use it. If they find any bugs they should report them
back to me.<br>
<br>
Having got that out of the way - what are the areas where you might want
to use <a href="index.html">Taglog</a> ?<br>
<br>
<h2>Client time recording</h2>
Set up each client as a Project, and when you are doing work for them switch
to their 'clock'. If they phone you then use the facility to right click
on Next when the phone rings to mark the Activity as an incomming phone call.
If you ring them then you can similarly mark the activity as an outoing phone
call. If you make notes of the conversations then you can use the log searching
facilites to check, for example what you said to them on any particular date.
You may wish to make paper notes, and then edit the entry afterwards.<br>
<br>
<h2>Client action management</h2>
You can use the actions facility to keep track of all the things which will
need to be done for a particular client, those which you are actively working
on and those which you have completed.<br>
<br>
<h2>Client communications</h2>
If you add the client as a Contact, and they have email, then you can arrange
for the client to be automatically kept up to date with your progress on
their work by setting up actions with client address set up in the Email-status-to
field of the action.<br>
