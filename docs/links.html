<h1>Time Management Resources</h1>


<h2>Programs</h2>

There are a large number of programs available which cover some aspect of
Time Management - I cover some of the Free Software ones here.
<p>
Note that I am the author of one of the these programs (
<a href="http://johnlines.github.io/taglog/index.html">TagLog</a>)
, but with Free
Software there is no advantage to me in whether you decide to use 
it, or some other package.
<p>
Free Software projects are often differentiated by different design
goals, so programs which may seem to perform a similar function are
not nescessarily in competition - for example Apache and thttpd both
serve web pages, but one is targeted at flexibility and the other at
small size.
Thus while I describe things below as strengths or weaknesses for simplicity
it would be more accurate to describe them as design goals and non-goals.

<h3><a href="http://johnlines.github.io/taglog/index.html">TagLog</a></h3>
My own program - keeps an electronic log of what you did, and allows you
to analyse it in various ways.
<p>
Strengths 
<ul>
<li>Combines pure time recording with keeping a diary
<li>Portable across platforms (Unix/Linux and Windows)
<li>Logs can be processed by other tools
<li>Available in English and German - other languages can be added.
</ul>
<p>
Weaknesses
<ul>
<li>The user interface take a bit of getting used to.
<li>It uses more screen space than a pure task timer.
<li>Not integrated with KDE,Gnome etc.
<li>Need to install TCL/TK
</ul>


<h3><a href=http://www.radix.net/~cknudsen/gtimer/>GTimer</a></h3>
Gtimer is a task timer and report generator, with a Gnome interface.
<p>
Strengths
<ul>
<li>Smaller desk footprint than taglog
<li>Integrated into the Gnome environment
<li>Can time more than one task at a time.
</ul>
<p>
Weaknesses
<ul>
<li>Only for Unix/Linux
</ul>


<h3><a href=http://www.timesleuth.org/>TimeSleuth</a></h3>
TimeSleuth is a time tracking application for Linux PDAs, such as the
Sharp Zaurus.




<h2>Web pages</h2>

There are a number of pages about Time Management scattered around the web,
these are just a few of the ones I have encountered.

<h3><a href=http://linas.org/linux/pm.html>Project Management & Bug Tracking for Linux</a></h3>
Links to many Bug Tracking projects for Linux, and some Time Management projects.

<h3><a href=http://www.linuxlinks.com/Software/ProductivityTools/Timers/>Linuxlinks ProductivityTools Timers section</a></h3>
Links to a comprehensive list of timer programs available under Linux

<h3><a href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/timemanagement/">Time Management from About.com</a></h3>
Several useful articles.


<h2>Software repositories and indexes</h2>
If you are looking for other Free or Open Source software the following sites
are worth investigating.

<h3><a href=http://freshmeat.net/appindex>The Freshmeat Application Index</a></h3>
Many pieces of software are announced on Freshmeat - if you have not visited it
then you should have a look, if only to appreciate the rate of growth in the
Open Source software world.
<p>
New releases of taglog are generally announced at
<a href=http://freshmeat.net/projects/taglog>http://freshmeat.net/projects/taglog</a>

<h3><a href=http://www.neosoft.com/tcl/contributed-software/>The Neosoft TCL contributed Software archive</a></h3>

This site has many pieces of TCL software.

<h3><a href=http://www.linux-directory.com>Linux Directory</a></h3>
Less comprehensive than Freshmeat, and it does not have an obvious section into
which time management software fits, but it goes beyond being a pure
application index, with entries for books and distributions.


<h2>Other links</h2>

<h3><a href="http://www.myersbriggs.org/">The Myers & Briggs Foundation</a></h3>
The Myers-Briggs personality type indicator test lets you work out which of 16 personality types you are. All have their own strengths and weaknesses, and if
you know what type of person you are it can help you to know where to look for
time management problems.
