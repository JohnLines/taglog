<h1>Taglog Internationalisation</h1>

<a href="index.html">Taglog</a> has an entry under File/Preferences which allows
a user to specify their preferred language.
This document explains what lies behind this, so that you can add support for
another language, and have it added to the main distribution.

<h2>Status</h2>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Language</th><th>Help file</th><th>Message Catalogue</th><tr>

<tr><td>Francais</td><td>not yet</td><td>Partial (by non-native speaker and machine translation)</td></tr>

</table>


<h2>Help files</h2>

Taglog has online help from most screens and menu buttons. This is implemented
by calling the routine "taghelp <i>help-id</i>". This looks up <i>help-id</i>
in taglog_help_<i>language</i>.tag where <i>language</i> is a two character
language code which should match the value of the language variable set in
Preferences.
<p>
To create a new taglog_help_<i>language</i>.tag file first copy
taglog_help_en.tag to the new file, and then edit the sections between
<pre>
Description:: END_D
and
END_D
</pre>
<p>
Note that the UNKNOWN entry is output when the help system can not find an
entry for a particular help-id.
<p>
The current version of the program is substituted for $1 in the About entry.
Further entries with variable text may appear in the future.

<h2>Message catalogs</h2>

Much of the text in taglog (menu buttons etc) is passed through the TCL
msgcat system before it is output. Translations for these messages are held
in files called <i>language</i>.msg, for example de.msg for Deutsch.
<p>
The file for the language set in File/Preferences is read in when the
program starts. To change the language used for the messages catalog you
have to restart the program.
<p>
The message cataglog for a particular language can have comment lines
starting with a # character, followed by a line which reads
<pre>
namespace import -force msgcat::mcset
</pre>

This is followed by lots of lines of the form
<pre>
msgcat <i>language EnglishText TranslatedText</i>
</pre>
for example
<pre>
msgcat de Help Hilfe
</pre>

<p>
Note that while the bulk of the program text is output through the message
catalog there are still some bits which are not.


<h2>Web pages and other documentation</h2>

I would welcome assistance in translating the
<a href="index.html">taglog</a> web pages into other languages. At present I
have only brief descriptions (taken from the <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian</a>
package description translations) of the program in:
<br>
<a href="taglog.de.html">Deutsch</a>
<a href="taglog.it.html">Italiano</a>
<br>
and based on Google translations in:
<br>
<a href="taglog.fr.html">Fran&ccedil;ais</a>
<a href="taglog.es.html">Espa&ntilde;ol</a>
<a href="taglog.pt.html">Portugu&ecirc;s</a>
<br>
Put together from bits and pieces
<a href="taglog.cy.html">Gymraeg</a>
<a href="taglog.nl.html">Nederlands</a>
