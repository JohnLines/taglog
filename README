		Taglog - an actions logging program

Taglog provides an electronic workbook, combining logging of time to projects
with keeping a detailed diary of what you actually do. Individual work
elements can be tagged by project, allowing you to produce, for example, a
record of work on one particular project, even if your time is spread across
a number of projects.

Work items can also be tagged by activity type - for example meeting, phone,
programming etc - allowing you to analyse where your time is going by activity.
Note that this activity type is orthogonal to the project axis, so that - for
example - user support would be a project - in the larger sense WHAT you are
doing - and phone calls to users - HOW you are doing it - would be the activity
type.

Initialisation
--------------

Taglog reads a configuration file to find default values for some things.
It looks in /etc/taglog.conf and ~/.taglog and sources each of these in turn,
so these must contain valid TCL. If it does not find either it uses defaults
built into the program.

The main thing it finds in the configuration file is the list of projects you
are working on. It is best to create this using Project/Add from within the
program. Then you can override the other preferences settings yourelf.

Most of the preferences can be edited from the File/Preferences menu item.
