<h2>
Getting Started<a NAME="getting_started"></a></h2>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>I assume you have already installed taglog, as described in <a href="http://www.paladin.demon.co.uk/tag-types/taglog/INSTALL">the
installation instructions&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;&nbsp; Run it in the appropriate
way for your platform
<p>The initial screen should look like this:
<br><img SRC="initial.jpg" height=678 width=478 ALT="Initial Screen Image">
<p>At the top is a menubar, below that is a window which shows the previous
entries for today, which will be empty if this is the first time you have
run the program. Below this is a bar with the buttons related to the current
entry - like this:
<p><img SRC="currentbar.jpg" height=41 width=415 ALT="Current Bar Image">
<p>Note that the Start time should be the time that you started the program,
and that the End time will increase every minute.
<p>Try entering some text in the entry window (the one at the bottom),
and then click on 'Next'
<p>The text you entered in the entry window should appear in the days log
window, labeled with its start and end times.
<br>What you have learned so far should help you if you simply wish to
keep a record of what you did during the day - an electronic day book,
with the advantage of having the entries automatically time stamped.
<h2>
<a NAME="Logging by Project"></a>Logging by Project</h2>
&nbsp;
<p>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The next stage is to add some Projects.
<br>Click on Projects on the top menubar, which will bring down a sub menu.
Click on 'Add...'
<br>A window will pop up which allows you to type in the name of a project.&nbsp;
Enter names for the projects you spend time on.
<p>On the 'current' menubar is a button labeled Project - click on it to
produce a menu, which should include the names of the project or projects
you have just added. You can select the name of a project to be associated
with the current log entry by selecting the project through that menu entry,
or by entering the name of the project in the field next to the 'Project;
button. Note that entering the project in the field will not add it to
the list of available projects for selection.
<p>Try making some log entries associated with different proejcts, then
click on Projects/View in the main menubar. A window will pop up showing
the time spent on all the projects you have used. Entries which have no
project associated with them are labeled as unknown.
<p>
You can find out more about Projects in the <a href="tutorial_projects.html">
Projects</a> chapter of the tutorial.

<h2>
<a NAME="Logging by Activity"></a>Logging by Activity</h2>
You may also wish to associate log entries by activity. The activiites
can be selected from a sub menu of the Project button in the 'current'
menubar. The current activity can be cleared by selecting the entry '--'.
<p>You can also select an activity by *Right Clicking* on Next, which pops
up a menu of activities. Selecting one starts the next log entry, with
the activity field set to whatever you selected.
<p>
Under the Reports menu you can select "Time by Activity" which shows a
breakdown of how your time is spent on various activities.
<p>
The names of the activities are read from a file, usually called
<tt>activities</tt> in the same place as your other taglog files, but the
location of this file can be changed in the preferences.



<h2>
<a NAME="Adjusting the Start Time"></a>Adjusting the Start Time</h2>
Sometimes you will`not be able to click the next button at the time that
you start a new acitvity - you might not be at your computer, or you may
forget to do it. If you realise that the current log entry should have
started earlier than the time shown you can click on the 'Start' button
to correct it. This will pop up a window like this:
<p><IMG src="adjstart.jpg" height=236 width=189 ALT="Start Time Adjustment Image">
<p>You can use the slider to alter the time, or enter a new time. If the
'Adjust previous end time' box is checked (the default) then the end time
of the previous entry will be adjusted to match.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Exiting the program"></a>Exiting the program</h2>

<p><br>To exit the program at the end of the day select 'File' in the main
menubar, and then 'Exit'. You will be prompted to enter a summary of the
days events. You can skip this by pressing 'Cancel' on the summary window.
<p>You can also exit by selecting 'Quit', which exits immediately, without
saving the current item.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Viewing previous logs"></a>Viewing previous logs</h2>
Once you have several days worth of logs you will find that you want to
find out what you did on a particular day, or follow the history of a particular
project. To do this select 'File/Open...' from the main menubar.
<p>You will be offered a popup with the dates for which there are log entries.
The dates are in the form <em>monthday</em> - for example <tt>0704</tt> is the
Fourth of July.
<p><img SRC="logsel.jpg" ALT="Log selection window" height=275 width=348>
<p>Select the dates you are interested in, and click OK. You can restrict
the display to a particular project by clicking on the Project button and
selecting its name from the drop down menu, or by
<br>typing its name in the field next to the Project button.
<p>There is an option to save the displayed entries to a file, which can
be used to create a report of work on a particular project, for example
to mail to other people interested in progress on that project.
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Displaying the time spent on projects"></a>Displaying the time
spent on projects</h2>

<p><br>The program keeps a running total of the time spent on all the projects
you have used today. To display it use the option 'Projects/View' in the
main menu bar.
<p>The time spent on the current project, and the total time spent is continously
updated. Note that if you have a project called 'breaks' (by default -
strictly any project in the breaks_projects list) then it is counted separately
from working projects,
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<h2>
<a NAME="Reporting project bookings for a week."></a>Reporting project
bookings for a week.</h2>
Once you have been running the program for a week you can produce a report
of time spent, by project, for the whole week, with summaries of total
time per day, and total time per project. To do this select 'Reports/Weekly
time booking by project' from the main menubar.
<p>You will see a pop up window like
<p><img SRC="seltime.jpg" ALT="Time selection window" height=127 width=346>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Enter a week number, or increase or decrease using the '-' and '+' buttoms
and press 'OK'
<br>You can display the times as hours and minutes or as decimal hours,
or as decimal days.
<br>&nbsp;

<p>There are other features of the program which are not yet covered in
this tutorial, some (such as actions) are not fully complete, but will
be added to the tutorial as soon as they are ready. Refer to the TODO list
to see which features are still waiting to be implemented, and to the changelog
to find out about recent changes. Please feel free to experiment, and to
let me know which facilities you find useful, and any ideas which may improve
the program
