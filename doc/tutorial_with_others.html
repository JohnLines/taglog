<h1>Taglog tutorial - working with other systems</h1>

Although taglog is primarily focussed on time management for an individual
it has some features which help it to work with other systesm.
These features require some setup outside of taglog so if you are working
purely standalone you can skip this section.



<h2>Saving Time Bookings for import to another program</h2>

You can save the output of the weekly time bookings as a Comma Separated
Value file.
This can be used to automate entry into a corporate time recording system,
but the exact details will depend on the requirements of your corporate system.
<p>
To save the to a file select <tt>Reports/Weekly time bookings by project</tt>
from the main menu and set the week you want to report for.
<p>
Select <tt>Save As...</tt> from the report display. You will be prompted for
the file name to use to save the displayed times as a CSV file.

<h3>File Format</h3>
The file is saved as a line containing the dates for which the report has
been generated, comma seperated with an initial leading comma.
The dates are expressed as Day/Month.
<p>
This is followed by as many lines as there are projects, starting with a
project booking code and then the times spent on that project on each
day of that week, all separated by commas.

<h3>Advanced facilities</h3>

There are some advanced facilities which can be set by manually editing your
taglog configuration file (<tt>~/.taglog</tt> on Unix or <tt>taglog.cfg</tt>
on Windows).
You can edit this file with an editor and make changes in the section after
the line which says
<pre>
# above this line is automatically saved - put your changes below here
</pre>
Even if you do know know the TCL language in which taglog is written it is
fairly simple to follow the syntax of the lines above the marker, which are
set by the <tt>File/Preferences</tt> menu entry.

<h4>Default Timebookings Save File</h4>

You can save the default file for the SaveAs operation by putting lines
into your taglog configuration file which read

<br>
global default_save_timebookings_file
<br>
set default_save_timebookings_file "<em>some filename</em>"
<br>

<p>
You will still be prompted to confirm the filename.

<h4>Timebookings File Format</h4>

Unix and Windows have different ways to indicate the end of a line of text.
If you are running taglog on a Unix or Linux system and saving your Timebookings
CSV file to a network drive on a Windows shared drive where it will be read
by an application expecting a Windows text file, or you are running taglog
on a Windows PC to a network drive where the CSV file will be read by a Unix
application you may need to change the file format.
<p>
If you are saving to the same kind of system as the one where the file will
be read (or you have a flexible program reading the files) then you do not
need to set this, but if you do then put the approporiate lines in your
taglog configuration:
<br>
<h5>Saving in Windows format</h5>
<br>
global timebookings_file_format
<br>
set timebookings_file_format crlf

<h5>Saving in Unix or Linux format</h5>
<br>
global timebookings_file_format
<br>
set timebookings_file_format lf


<h2>Updating Projects information over HTTP</h2>

If your organization has a web server which can deliver a list of the
currently available project names and booking codes then you can set up
a URL in the <tt>Projects URL</tt> field in preferences.
<p>
Once this is enabled you can update your current list of available projects
via the <tt>Projects/Update</tt> menu entry.

<p>
Note that this URL could be something like
<pre>
http://projects.example.com/projects-list.php?jl
</pre>
to deliver only the projects relevant to a particular person.


<h3>Setting up the Projects information server</h3>

This section is under construction.
The Projects information server should deliver the projects which are
valid for the particular user (or possibly just the same set of projects
to everybody) in the tagged format described in
<a href="http://www.paladin.demon.co.uk/tag-types/">http://www.paladin.demon.co.uk/tag-types/</a>
for example it should look like
<pre>
Tag-accountproj-version: 1.0
End:

Name: breaks
NextActionId: 1
Code:
Flags: Breaks
Flags: Active
StartDate: 2002-12-11
End:
Name: general admin
NextActionId: 1
Code:
Flags: Overheads
Flags: Active
StartDate: 2002-12-11
End:
Name: Major Project1 
NextActionId: 1
Code: MP1
StartDate: 2002-12-11
End:
</pre>
and so on.
<p>

<! snippet of PHP code for sending project information here >

Taglog will detect a project being removed from the active projects list
downloaded here and will set the EndDate of such projects to todays date.

other time management systems >
